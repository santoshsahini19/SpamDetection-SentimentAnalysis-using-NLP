# SpamDetection-SentimentAnalysis-using-NLP

This project contains simple implementation of Spam detection and Sentiment Analysis using email data

__Part 1: Data Preprocessing__

- Email data is cleaned by removing punctuations, tags, digits and special characters present in the text
- Used wordcloud to analyze high frequency words present in spam and non spam emails

__Part 2: Spam Detection__

- I performed binary classification in order to classify whether an email is spam or not and achieved 97% accuracy
- While building this model, I explored tokenization, vectorization and statistical algorithms

__Part 3: Sentiment Analysis__

- I built sentiment analysis model using a simple text processing library 'textblob'
- This library is simple to use and contains common NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis etc.,
